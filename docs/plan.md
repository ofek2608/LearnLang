# Plan
This file contains information about the goal, what shoud the website contain.

## Exercises
Excercises are the way the player learns alone, they pick a type of excercise and then they will practice the language they want to learn.

For a list of potential exercises ideas check [ExerciseTypes](./exercise-types.md).

## Quizes
Quizes are the way the player can share learning resources with other users. Quizes may have a specific theme, such as animals, food and so. Quizes are built from the same content as excercises, but they are compiled. The quiz creator can enable: time limit, score, leaderboard. Quizes may be played as multiplayer to see who can get more questions on the same seed, or who can answer first.

## Pages
People can make pages using markdown format. The pages can explain things about the language such as stems, conjugations, tenses, difference between words, ect. Pages can also be questions for help. Pages can link to other resources such as quizes, other pages, or external websites. Pages have comments (which are also markdown), edit suggestions. People will be able to see recently created pages/comments and search for pages by text or tags. Some of these markdown will become official and will be displayed to people when they need to learn it. Markdowns will have comments and edit suggestions.
